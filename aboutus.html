                    <p>As a child, Brody Nguyen always had a passion for food and was a little bigger than your average child. He knew from a young age he wanted to work in the food industry and be successful, but he also knew the amount of competition he'd face. Going through school and working towards his goal of owning a business Brody always lived by the philosophy that hard work will lead to success and satisfaction but no guarantee. When he graduated, he wasted no time to step into the food industry and gain as much experience as possible before opening his own business which soon became known as Harvest Haven.</p>

                    <p>Christian Vu grew up during a rough time and struggled to get along with his community and family. Often disrespectful and dismissive of other people's feelings, he was straight-up disrespectful. In his high school years, Christian shares a story that truly flipped his life around and where he gets his motivation and desire to please the people around him. Christian's friends were a guiding force and changed his life for the better, when he struggled in school walking home talking to his friends always guided and pushed him to become a better person and gave him encouragement to work hard. The newfound desire sought to ensure people's happiness, especially through his first job as a waiter at a restaurant. Working in the restaurant setting sparked a realization that the food industry is what he would want to work in as his life went on. Working towards customer relationships and profitable ideas for the business, Christian's dedication and commitment to the industry became evident, eventually landing him a promotion to general manager at Harvest Haven.</p>

                    <p>Allen Matthews grew up in the slums of New Jersey and had to work for every single meal starting at the young age of 9 years old. Growing up with a hard-working and loving family, he and his younger brother began learning the ins and outs of business culture from their father. Allen always aspired to become a business owner and work hard for the opportunities his mother and father were never given. Growing up in New Jersey, Allen and the rest of his peers were primarily Giants fans, he used this information of the fans of such a poverty franchise, and he jump started his business of selling his own homemade Giants merch outside in the parking lot at Metlife stadium from this he learned many methods of promoting his growing business. Through this, he was able to expand his business ventures and stepped into the food business, and found a love for foreign cultures and their cuisine.</p>

                    <p>Growing up as the black sheep of his community in Pearland, Texas, Cameron often failed to find genuine connections with his peers and had different interests that were not similar to others. Cameron then found Greek culture and mythology which at a young age he began studying. The timeless stories and the culture much different from his own fascinated him as a young boy. These interests blossomed into a love for Greek cuisine, finding the culture's flavors, recipes, and traditions. At the age of 16, he began cooking Greek cuisine with his own vegan twist. Through his cooking, he was able to share the love he put into the food with his community and with the homeless who were struggling to find their way. Cameron lives by the motto "Life is Good" and stands by it, meaning that food has the power to be the bridge in a community, bringing one another closer and striving for unity. Finding his future partners in Brody Nguyen, Christian Vu, Allen Matthews, and Kaleb Patel they opened up Harvest Haven led by Cameron's culinary arts.</p>

                    <p>Kaleb Patel's passion for working in the kitchen started at a young age, as he worked alongside his family. In his teenage years, Kaleb frequently experimented with different cultures and always had an innovative mind creating new dishes that had never been seen before. On a trip to Greece, Kaleb had an awakening and a life-changing experience, living on a farm for three weeks he found a bond and special connections with the animals grown within and began to sympathize with the cruelty animals face. From then on, he vowed to become a vegan and an activist working towards animals' rights. Coming back to the United States, he opened up a non-profit benefitting animals and raising money for equipment to help the animals live. Throughout all, he never lost sight of his cooking dream and began incorporating successful vegan dishes into the many different restaurants he's worked in, and heavily promoted an ethical living.</p>
